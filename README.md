# Beach Day
This is Group 1's project for the Spring 2025 semester of CS 330. Beach Day is a webapp designed to allow users to determine how their day at the beach is going to go. Users can enter the location of the beach they plan to travel to, and Beach Day will aggregate data from NOAA to inform users about a number of factors that can impact their day at the beach. Using Beach Day, users will know what the weather is like, what the waves are like, what the UV index is, and other things.

## Current State

- [*] Account Creation
