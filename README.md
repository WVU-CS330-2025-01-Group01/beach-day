# Beach Day
This is Group 1's project for the Spring 2025 semester of CS 330. Beach Day is a 
web app designed to allow users to effectively plan a trip to the beach. Users can enter
a specified beach to retrieve data on its weather reports, forecasts, and beach information.
The app is also personalizable as users can save a list of favorited beaches to their profile.
Furthermore, users can enter personal events for which dynamic alerts will be sent to their 
emails if there are any weather hazards. Using Beach Day, users will receive extensive 
information on their favorite beaches in one place.
