# Documentation Root

This is the root of the documentation for the project. Any aspect of the project that needs documentation should have documentation and it should be in this folder. All interfaces between the teams especially need documentation.

## Getting The Project Running
This app has multiple moving parts and requires setup on the developer's end before it can be run. Instructions for getting the project running can be found on the [Setting Up](setup.md) page.

## Routing
Routing refers to routes hosted by the backend. All communication between the frontend and backend is done through one of these routes. Documentation for these routes can be found on the [Routing](routing.md) page.
